> Gosonnx is an initiative that builds upon the ideas inspired by [WONNX](https://github.com/webonnx/wonnx).
> It's a from-the-ground-up rewrite, aiming to explore alternative methodologies and optimizations for different scenarios.
> While it adopts some aspects from WONNX, this project diverges in its approach and implementation.
> It is designed as a complementary exploration rather than a replacement, reflecting a personal interpretation and experimentation with the concepts.
> All due credit is given to WONNX maintainers for the original work that sparked this direction.
